If the steps of the first run have been completed, the Second run steps should be followed, otherwise follow the steps of the first run.\n\n### First run\n\n1. Create a memory bank directory at the top level of the project `./memory-bank`.\n2. Create a task tracking csv inside the memory bank `./memory-bank/task-tracking.csv`.\n3. Create an update log file inside the memory bank `./memory-bank/updatelog.md`.\n4. Create a specs directory inside the memory bank `./memory-bank/specs`.\n5. Read `./system/task-rules.md` file in the root directory.\n6. If the user doesn't have a CLAUDE.md file, create one and append the text of @system/task-rules.md inside of it. If they have a CLAUDE.MD file, append the text in @system/task-rules.md at the bottom of it. Do not ever remove existing content in the claude md file. Do not put anyting else into the CLAUDE.md. \n7. If the user doesn't have a .claude folder with settings.json, create it with the content in `./systems/hooks.json` if they do have one, merge the hooks into their existings settings.json. It needs to be valid json. No trailing EOF or anything.\n8. Check the validity of the `.claude/settings.json` JSON file you created.\n9. Create an initial task inside the `task-tracking.csv` for setting up the project (basically representing the work of this command). Create the task based on the rules in `./system/task-rules.md` which is in the root directory of the project. \n10. Ask the user to restart their Claude.\n\n### Second run\n\n1. Append the text in @system/memory-system.md at the bottom of the CLAUDE.md file. Do not ever remove existing content in the claude md file. Do not put anyting else into the CLAUDE.md. \n2. Read the `./system/memory-system.md` file and create all the files/directories outlined by it in the users project.\n3. Merge `./system/memory-hooks.md` into the existing `.claude/settings.json` file. It needs to be valid JSON. No trailing EOF or anything. Check the validity of the JSON explicitly.\n4. Check the validity of the`.claude/settings.json` JSON file.\n5. Ask the user to restart their Claude.\n\n## Example usage\n\nUsage: /setup"}]},"isMeta":true,"uuid":"18a42cde-7db5-457c-b8a8-798bd680ddab","timestamp":"2025-08-27T17:18:23.259Z"}

Only once the user approves can the task be moved done.","+","+#### Done","+","+When marking a task as done, a timestamped section should be added to the bottom of the `<rootprojectdir>/memory-bank/updatelog.md` which summarizes the work added/done by the task.
